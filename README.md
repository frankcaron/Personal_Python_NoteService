PythonNoteService
=================

A simple note storage and editing web service written in Python to be consumed by apps.

The end-goal of this service will be to serve a RESTful API which persists, updates, creates, and deletes notes
on the cloud. This API will be consumed by device apps that provide the UX for the service.

There will be three total repositories when complete:
- PythonNoteService
- iOSNoteApp
- RubyOnRailsNoteWebPortal

This should be fun. Contributions, comments, and criticisms of my sloppy code welcome!
